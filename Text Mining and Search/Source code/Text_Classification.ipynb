But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations &amp; successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &amp;/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer &amp; others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act &amp; a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued &amp; given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia &amp; hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals &amp; well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed &amp; not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show &amp; radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest &amp; what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year &amp; hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this &amp; it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later &amp; the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin &amp; cliched &amp; the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing &amp; singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock &amp; his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written &amp; then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums &amp; on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings &amp; a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.</td>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>09 25, 2012</td>\n","      <td>the template of Christmas albums &amp; bands</td>\n","      <td>1348531200</td>\n","      <td>{'Format:': ' Audio CD'}</td>\n","      <td>7.0</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>5259</td>\n","      <td>CD</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0005465079</th>\n","      <td>A14YR7QK3ASFFW</td>\n","      <td>Amazon Customer</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>That one song has to be one of the best in CCM.

He is miles away from showing himself off with what he's doing which seems to be the usual these days. And the sound of that kit? In my humble opinion that's the way a drumkit should sound, wide open,lots of projection and sweet tom-toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit, which is the current tendency. Listening to this DVD, even though I still haven't done it 5.1 is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music. The track performed are in that interesting area among jazz,rock and fusion so there is something for everyone here. The interview with Simon talking about the 5.1 mix, which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters. Least but not last, even though this DVD has no subtitles, is perfectly understandable because of Simon's slow and plain british accent, so it won't be a problem for any audiences worldwide.\\nFive stars/thumbs for Simon....again!</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>11 5, 2008</td>\n","      <td>Exciting, amusing and very useful.</td>\n","      <td>1225843200</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>1642</td>\n","      <td>CD</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0788602144</th>\n","      <td>A2CS77CAOHQV02</td>\n","      <td>Don E.

So, we get to see mostly kinescopes.  But, if you can get past the sub-standard video quality, these are well worth owning, whether you grew up in the 60s (as I did) or you are curious about the entertainment of that era.\\n\\nThese shows make a person feel happy.  The reason is that if you look closely you can see that the entertainers are often enjoying themselves.  It's infectious.  It makes you want to share in their happiness.  A person can see that although it may have been a job for the entertainers, especially the dancers, and a lot of work went into the show, they liked what they were doing.  It's mostly very upbeat.  This is in contrast to much of the entertainment today, which is drenched in empty electronica, fake drums, and urban anger.  Hullaballo was about the beat (\"Feel that beat, comin on...), the excitement and the dancing.  The dancers were a very important part of this show.  Watch closely during the Hullaballo A Go Go segments and you will conclude that they are really having fun while they are working.  With all of the depressing musical entertainment that exists today, it's refreshing to listen to (mostly)upbeat music in a happy setting.  It's like leaving a cold gray rainy winter day to go to a beautiful June wedding reception.  So, if you enjoy dancing, or want some escapist happiness, buy this and have a good time!

But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations &amp; successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &amp;/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer &amp; others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act &amp; a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued &amp; given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia &amp; hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals &amp; well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed &amp; not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show &amp; radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest &amp; what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year &amp; hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this &amp; it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later &amp; the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin &amp; cliched &amp; the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing &amp; singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock &amp; his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written &amp; then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums &amp; on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings &amp; a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.</td>\n","      <td>the template of Christmas albums &amp; bands</td>\n","      <td>7.0</td>\n","      <td>5259</td>\n","      <td>CD</td>\n","      <td>[in, the, s, if, anyone, had, said, that, the, struggling, florida, metal, band, savatage, would, eventually, become, one, of, the, most, popular, let, alone, physically, largest, bands, in, music, with, two, independent, groups, on, the, road, everyone, probably, would, have, laughed, including, the, band, itself, but, it, s, one, of, the, more, unique, histories, transformations, successes, in, the, rock, archives, let, alone, spawning, one, of, the, most, popular, christmas, rock, albums, a, musician, could, hope, for, briefly, with, new, new, york, guitarist, al, pitrelli, who, would, later, spend, two, years, kicking, it, the, thrash, way, with, megadeth, savatage, recorded, the, ...]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0005465079</th>\n","      <td>That one song has to be one of the best in CCM.

The reason is that if you look closely you can see that the entertainers are often enjoying themselves.  It's infectious.  It makes you want to share in their happiness.  A person can see that although it may have been a job for the entertainers, especially the dancers, and a lot of work went into the show, they liked what they were doing.  It's mostly very upbeat.  This is in contrast to much of the entertainment today, which is drenched in empty electronica, fake drums, and urban anger.  Hullaballo was about the beat (\"Feel that beat, comin on...), the excitement and the dancing.  The dancers were a very important part of this show.  Watch closely during the Hullaballo A Go Go segments and you will conclude that they are really having fun while they are working.  With all of the depressing musical entertainment that exists today, it's refreshing to listen to (mostly)upbeat music in a happy setting.

Keith Green had a passionate love for Jesus.  This is evident in his life as well as in his music.  He didn't preach Jesus at concerts sponsored by beer companies.  He didn't get divorced and remarried.  He didn't live a life of luxury off of his royalties while billions starved.  He was the real deal.  He was a real Christian.\\n\\nMuch of his music consists of love songs to God, and listening to this music Keith's love for Jesus encourages me.  Hearing the tender serenades of a true lover of Jesus fans the flame of the listener's own passion.  It's contagious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ...

But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations & successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer & others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act & a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued & given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia & hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve & Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals & well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed & not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show & radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest & what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve & Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year & hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this & it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later & the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin & cliched & the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing & singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock & his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written & then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums & on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings & a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.  ...

It tells the story of the resurrection from Peter's eyes. It is very true to the Bible in its lyrics. Adam Where Are You is another solid song.

Truely sensational!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ...

He is miles away from showing himself off with what he's doing which seems to be the usual these days. And the sound of that kit? In my humble opinion that's the way a drumkit should sound, wide open,lots of projection and sweet tom-toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit, which is the current tendency. Listening to this DVD, even though I still haven't done it 5.1 is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music. The track performed are in that interesting area among jazz,rock and fusion so there is something for everyone here. The interview with Simon talking about the 5.1 mix, which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters. Least but not last, even though this DVD has no subtitles, is perfectly understandable because of Simon's slow and plain british accent, so it won't be a problem for any audiences worldwide.\\nFive stars/thumbs for Simon....again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ...

So, we get to see mostly kinescopes.  But, if you can get past the sub-standard video quality, these are well worth owning, whether you grew up in the 60s (as I did) or you are curious about the entertainment of that era.\\n\\nThese shows make a person feel happy.  The reason is that if you look closely you can see that the entertainers are often enjoying themselves.  It's infectious.  It makes you want to share in their happiness.  A person can see that although it may have been a job for the entertainers, especially the dancers, and a lot of work went into the show, they liked what they were doing.  It's mostly very upbeat.  This is in contrast to much of the entertainment today, which is drenched in empty electronica, fake drums, and urban anger.  Hullaballo was about the beat (\"Feel that beat, comin on...), the excitement and the dancing.  The dancers were a very important part of this show.  Watch closely during the Hullaballo A Go Go segments and you will conclude that they are really having fun while they are working.  With all of the depressing musical entertainment that exists today, it's refreshing to listen to (mostly)upbeat music in a happy setting.  It's like leaving a cold gray rainy winter day to go to a beautiful June wedding reception.  So, if you enjoy dancing, or want some escapist happiness, buy this and have a good time!  And, don't forget to buy Shindig! too.

But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations &amp; successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &amp;/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer &amp; others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act &amp; a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued &amp; given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia &amp; hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals &amp; well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed &amp; not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show &amp; radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest &amp; what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year &amp; hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this &amp; it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later &amp; the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin &amp; cliched &amp; the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing &amp; singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock &amp; his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written &amp; then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums &amp; on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings &amp; a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.</td>\n","      <td>the template of Christmas albums &amp; bands</td>\n","      <td>7.0</td>\n","      <td>5259</td>\n","      <td>CD</td>\n","      <td>[in, the, s, if, anyone, had, said, that, the, struggling, florida, metal, band, savatage, would, eventually, become, one, of, the, most, popular, let, alone, physically, largest, bands, in, music, with, two, independent, groups, on, the, road, everyone, probably, would, have, laughed, including, the, band, itself, but, it, s, one, of, the, more, unique, histories, transformations, successes, in, the, rock, archives, let, alone, spawning, one, of, the, most, popular, christmas, rock, albums, a, musician, could, hope, for, briefly, with, new, new, york, guitarist, al, pitrelli, who, would, later, spend, two, years, kicking, it, the, thrash, way, with, megadeth, savatage, recorded, the, ...]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0005465079</th>\n","      <td>That one song has to be one of the best in CCM.

He is miles away from showing himself off with what he's doing which seems to be the usual these days. And the sound of that kit? In my humble opinion that's the way a drumkit should sound, wide open,lots of projection and sweet tom-toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit, which is the current tendency. Listening to this DVD, even though I still haven't done it 5.1 is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music. The track performed are in that interesting area among jazz,rock and fusion so there is something for everyone here. The interview with Simon talking about the 5.1 mix, which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters. Least but not last, even though this DVD has no subtitles, is perfectly understandable because of Simon's slow and plain british accent, so it won't be a problem for any audiences worldwide.\\nFive stars/thumbs for Simon....again!</td>\n","      <td>Exciting, amusing and very useful.</td>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>1642</td>\n","      <td>CD</td>\n","      <td>[i, imagine, simon, phillips, needs, no, introduction, indeed, so, we, can, skip, that, part, the, amazing, thing, about, this, long, awaited, dvd, is, the, fact, that, all, these, great, and, complicated, stuff, phillips, executes, are, whithin, the, context, of, great, music, written, by, him, and, performed, with, two, other, great, musicians, otherwise, what, would, be, the, point, of, such, amazing, technique, and, skill, through, very, clear, chapters, simon, explains, how, to, tune, why, he, position, himself, like, that, behind, the, kit, etc, in, a, humble, way, only, great, a, talented, people, can, show, the, double, bass, technique, is, explained, and, ...]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0788602144</th>\n","      <td>I rate this and the other Hullabaloo DVD and VHS sets 4 stars rather than 5 only because most of the color tapes were trashed.  So, we get to see mostly kinescopes.  But, if you can get past the sub-standard video quality, these are well worth owning, whether you grew up in the 60s (as I did) or you are curious about the entertainment of that era.\\n\\nThese shows make a person feel happy.  The reason is that if you look closely you can see that the entertainers are often enjoying themselves.  It's infectious.  It makes you want to share in their happiness.  A person can see that although it may have been a job for the entertainers, especially the dancers, and a lot of work went into the show, they liked what they were doing.  It's mostly very upbeat.  This is in contrast to much of the entertainment today, which is drenched in empty electronica, fake drums, and urban anger.  Hullaballo was about the beat (\"Feel that beat, comin on...), the excitement and the dancing.  The dancers were a very important part of this show.  Watch closely during the Hullaballo A Go Go segments and you will conclude that they are really having fun while they are working.  With all of the depressing musical entertainment that exists today, it's refreshing to listen to (mostly)upbeat music in a happy setting.  It's like leaving a cold gray rainy winter day to go to a beautiful June wedding reception.  So, if you enjoy dancing, or want some escapist happiness, buy this and have a good time!  And, don't forget to buy Shindig! too.

Keith Green had a passionate love for Jesus.  This is evident in his life as well as in his music.  He didn't preach Jesus at concerts sponsored by beer companies.  He didn't get divorced and remarried.  He didn't live a life of luxury off of his royalties while billions starved.  He was the real deal.  He was a real Christian.\\n\\nMuch of his music consists of love songs to God, and listening to this music Keith's love for Jesus encourages me.  Hearing the tender serenades of a true lover of Jesus fans the flame of the listener's own passion.  It's contagious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ...

But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations & successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer & others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act & a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued & given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia & hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve & Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals & well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed & not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show & radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest & what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve & Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year & hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this & it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later & the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin & cliched & the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing & singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock & his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written & then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums & on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings & a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.  ...

It tells the story of the resurrection from Peter's eyes. It is very true to the Bible in its lyrics. Adam Where Are You is another solid song.

Truely sensational!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ...

He is miles away from showing himself off with what he's doing which seems to be the usual these days. And the sound of that kit? In my humble opinion that's the way a drumkit should sound, wide open,lots of projection and sweet tom-toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit, which is the current tendency. Listening to this DVD, even though I still haven't done it 5.1 is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music. The track performed are in that interesting area among jazz,rock and fusion so there is something for everyone here. The interview with Simon talking about the 5.1 mix, which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters. Least but not last, even though this DVD has no subtitles, is perfectly understandable because of Simon's slow and plain british accent, so it won't be a problem for any audiences worldwide.\\nFive stars/thumbs for Simon....again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ...

So, we get to see mostly kinescopes.  But, if you can get past the sub-standard video quality, these are well worth owning, whether you grew up in the 60s (as I did) or you are curious about the entertainment of that era.\\n\\nThese shows make a person feel happy.  The reason is that if you look closely you can see that the entertainers are often enjoying themselves.  It's infectious.  It makes you want to share in their happiness.  A person can see that although it may have been a job for the entertainers, especially the dancers, and a lot of work went into the show, they liked what they were doing.  It's mostly very upbeat.  This is in contrast to much of the entertainment today, which is drenched in empty electronica, fake drums, and urban anger.  Hullaballo was about the beat (\"Feel that beat, comin on...), the excitement and the dancing.  The dancers were a very important part of this show.  Watch closely during the Hullaballo A Go Go segments and you will conclude that they are really having fun while they are working.  With all of the depressing musical entertainment that exists today, it's refreshing to listen to (mostly)upbeat music in a happy setting.  It's like leaving a cold gray rainy winter day to go to a beautiful June wedding reception.  So, if you enjoy dancing, or want some escapist happiness, buy this and have a good time!

But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations &amp; successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &amp;/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer &amp; others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act &amp; a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued &amp; given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia &amp; hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals &amp; well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed &amp; not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show &amp; radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest &amp; what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year &amp; hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this &amp; it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later &amp; the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin &amp; cliched &amp; the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing &amp; singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock &amp; his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written &amp; then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums &amp; on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings &amp; a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.</td>\n","      <td>the template of Christmas albums &amp; bands</td>\n","      <td>7.0</td>\n","      <td>5259</td>\n","      <td>CD</td>\n","      <td>[in, the, s, if, anyone, had, said, that, the, struggling, florida, metal, band, savatage, would, eventually, become, one, of, the, most, popular, let, alone, physically, largest, bands, in, music, with, two, independent, groups, on, the, road, everyone, probably, would, have, laughed, including, the, band, itself, but, it, s, one, of, the, more, unique, histories, transformations, successes, in, the, rock, archives, let, alone, spawning, one, of, the, most, popular, christmas, rock, albums, a, musician, could, hope, for, briefly, with, new, new, york, guitarist, al, pitrelli, who, would, later, spend, two, years, kicking, it, the, thrash, way, with, megadeth, savatage, recorded, the, ...]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0005465079</th>\n","      <td>That one song has to be one of the best in CCM.

He is miles away from showing himself off with what he's doing which seems to be the usual these days. And the sound of that kit? In my humble opinion that's the way a drumkit should sound, wide open,lots of projection and sweet tom-toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit, which is the current tendency. Listening to this DVD, even though I still haven't done it 5.1 is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music. The track performed are in that interesting area among jazz,rock and fusion so there is something for everyone here. The interview with Simon talking about the 5.1 mix, which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters. Least but not last, even though this DVD has no subtitles, is perfectly understandable because of Simon's slow and plain british accent, so it won't be a problem for any audiences worldwide.\\nFive stars/thumbs for Simon....again!</td>\n","      <td>Exciting, amusing and very useful.</td>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>1642</td>\n","      <td>CD</td>\n","      <td>[i, imagine, simon, phillips, needs, no, introduction, indeed, so, we, can, skip, that, part, the, amazing, thing, about, this, long, awaited, dvd, is, the, fact, that, all, these, great, and, complicated, stuff, phillips, executes, are, whithin, the, context, of, great, music, written, by, him, and, performed, with, two, other, great, musicians, otherwise, what, would, be, the, point, of, such, amazing, technique, and, skill, through, very, clear, chapters, simon, explains, how, to, tune, why, he, position, himself, like, that, behind, the, kit, etc, in, a, humble, way, only, great, a, talented, people, can, show, the, double, bass, technique, is, explained, and, ...]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0788602144</th>\n","      <td>I rate this and the other Hullabaloo DVD and VHS sets 4 stars rather than 5 only because most of the color tapes were trashed.  So, we get to see mostly kinescopes.  But, if you can get past the sub-standard video quality, these are well worth owning, whether you grew up in the 60s (as I did) or you are curious about the entertainment of that era.\\n\\nThese shows make a person feel happy.  The reason is that if you look closely you can see that the entertainers are often enjoying themselves.  It's infectious.  It makes you want to share in their happiness.  A person can see that although it may have been a job for the entertainers, especially the dancers, and a lot of work went into the show, they liked what they were doing.  It's mostly very upbeat.  This is in contrast to much of the entertainment today, which is drenched in empty electronica, fake drums, and urban anger.  Hullaballo was about the beat (\"Feel that beat, comin on...), the excitement and the dancing.  The dancers were a very important part of this show.  Watch closely during the Hullaballo A Go Go segments and you will conclude that they are really having fun while they are working.  With all of the depressing musical entertainment that exists today, it's refreshing to listen to (mostly)upbeat music in a happy setting.  It's like leaving a cold gray rainy winter day to go to a beautiful June wedding reception.  So, if you enjoy dancing, or want some escapist happiness, buy this and have a good time!  And, don't forget to buy Shindig! too.  Very similar.</td>\n","      <td>If You Enjoy Smiling, Buy This!</td>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>1542</td>\n","      <td>CD</td>\n","      <td>[i, rate, this, and, the, other, hullabaloo,

Keith Green had a passionate love for Jesus.  This is evident in his life as well as in his music.  He didn't preach Jesus at concerts sponsored by beer companies.  He didn't get divorced and remarried.  He didn't live a life of luxury off of his royalties while billions starved.  He was the real deal.  He was a real Christian.\\n\\nMuch of his music consists of love songs to God, and listening to this music Keith's love for Jesus encourages me.  Hearing the tender serenades of a true lover of Jesus fans the flame of the listener's own passion.  It's contagious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ...

But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations & successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer & others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act & a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued & given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia & hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve & Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals & well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed & not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show & radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest & what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve & Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year & hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this & it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later & the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin & cliched & the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing & singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock & his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written & then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums & on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings & a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.  ...

It tells the story of the resurrection from Peter's eyes. It is very true to the Bible in its lyrics. Adam Where Are You is another solid song.

Truely sensational!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ...

He is miles away from showing himself off with what he's doing which seems to be the usual these days. And the sound of that kit? In my humble opinion that's the way a drumkit should sound, wide open,lots of projection and sweet tom-toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit, which is the current tendency. Listening to this DVD, even though I still haven't done it 5.1 is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music. The track performed are in that interesting area among jazz,rock and fusion so there is something for everyone here. The interview with Simon talking about the 5.1 mix, which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters. Least but not last, even though this DVD has no subtitles, is perfectly understandable because of Simon's slow and plain british accent, so it won't be a problem for any audiences worldwide.\\nFive stars/thumbs for Simon....again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ...

So, we get to see mostly kinescopes.  But, if you can get past the sub-standard video quality, these are well worth owning, whether you grew up in the 60s (as I did) or you are curious about the entertainment of that era.\\n\\nThese shows make a person feel happy.  The reason is that if you look closely you can see that the entertainers are often enjoying themselves.  It's infectious.  It makes you want to share in their happiness.  A person can see that although it may have been a job for the entertainers, especially the dancers, and a lot of work went into the show, they liked what they were doing.  It's mostly very upbeat.  This is in contrast to much of the entertainment today, which is drenched in empty electronica, fake drums, and urban anger.  Hullaballo was about the beat (\"Feel that beat, comin on...), the excitement and the dancing.  The dancers were a very important part of this show.  Watch closely during the Hullaballo A Go Go segments and you will conclude that they are really having fun while they are working.  With all of the depressing musical entertainment that exists today, it's refreshing to listen to (mostly)upbeat music in a happy setting.  It's like leaving a cold gray rainy winter day to go to a beautiful June wedding reception.  So, if you enjoy dancing, or want some escapist happiness, buy this and have a good time!  And, don't forget to buy Shindig! too.

But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations &amp; successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &amp;/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer &amp; others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act &amp; a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued &amp; given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia &amp; hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals &amp; well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed &amp; not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show &amp; radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest &amp; what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year &amp; hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this &amp; it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later &amp; the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin &amp; cliched &amp; the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing &amp; singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock &amp; his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written &amp; then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums &amp; on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings &amp; a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing

would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with megadeth savatage recorded the excellent concept album dead winter dead based upon the bosnian war which atlantic records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights the instrumental christmas eve sarajevo musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song carol of the bells this was nt the first time the band had given traditional or classical music metal flourishes let alone the tradition extended back to led zeppelin yes emerson lake palmer others the single became the success the band was looking for sort of it s climb up the charts was marred by the band s metal sounding name that frightened radio djs tso was created to boost the single past preconceived notions though it was actually the same line up but with rotating vocalists a slightly less venonomous stage act a prominent composing role for savatage session keyboards bob kinkel christmas eve sarajevo was reissued given a new story about an angel looking for something done on christmas day that represents everything good at one point he flys over bosnia hears a lone celloist christmas eve other stories pushed everything savatage had tried before to a new level a complex storyline as always courtesy of paul oneill a positive moral message of a strong christian nature radio friendly metal operatic vocals well known classical traditional songs given a metal twist the jury has remained out despite numerous albums later both holiday themed not on what exactly tso is many metal fans do nt consider it s heavily choreographed light show radio friendly tunes true metal while purist classical fans cry sacriledge albeit honestly it does nt take much for either group to cry out in discontent as for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest what is undeniable is that tso appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for from children to grandparents creating something for everyone even the purists if they give it a chance christmas eve other stories was focused on re releasing sarajevo a second year hoping it would be a chart success again but was essentially a one off project working alongside savatage as much as savatage would nt have been able to predict the creation of tso none of them would have predicted that savatage would also eventually completely morph into tso but there s no christmas album like this it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later the highlight of the tso catalog let alone one of the best christmas rock albums made so it s really no surprise that tso would eclipse its root band the lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin cliched the storyline takes itself too serious but there s no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album let alone the high caliber of playing singing across the board the biggest loss though is savatage vocalist zak stevens relegated to the chorus as he s one of the most under rated powerhouses in rock his operatic vocals are perfect for this project but luckily he s found new success in circle ii circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight speaking of lyrics the biggest hurdle with the album is that the page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song if not skipped at all while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis

In my humble opinion that's the way a drumkit should sound, wide open,lots of projection and sweet tom-toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit, which is the current tendency. Listening to this DVD, even though I still haven't done it 5.1 is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music.

The interview with Simon talking about the 5.1 mix, which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters.

\n","0001393774  Keith Green had a passionate love for Jesus.  This is evident in his life as well as in his music.  He didn't preach Jesus at concerts sponsored by beer companies.  He didn't get divorced and remarried.  He didn't live a life of luxury off of his royalties while billions starved.  He was the real deal.  He was a real Christian.\\n\\nMuch of his music consists of love songs to God, and listening to this music Keith's love for Jesus encourages me.  Hearing the tender serenades of a true lover of Jesus fans the flame of the listener's own passion.

But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations & successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer & others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act & a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued & given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia & hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve & Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals & well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed & not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show & radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest & what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve & Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year & hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this & it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later & the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin & cliched & the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing & singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock & his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written & then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums & on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings & a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.  ...

It tells the story of the resurrection from Peter's eyes. It is very true to the Bible in its lyrics. Adam Where Are You is another solid song.

Truely sensational!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ...

He is miles away from showing himself off with what he's doing which seems to be the usual these days. And the sound of that kit? In my humble opinion that's the way a drumkit should sound, wide open,lots of projection and sweet tom-toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit, which is the current tendency. Listening to this DVD, even though I still haven't done it 5.1 is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music. The track performed are in that interesting area among jazz,rock and fusion so there is something for everyone here. The interview with Simon talking about the 5.1 mix, which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters. Least but not last, even though this DVD has no subtitles, is perfectly understandable because of Simon's slow and plain british accent, so it won't be a problem for any audiences worldwide.\\nFive stars/thumbs for Simon....again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ...

So, we get to see mostly kinescopes.  But, if you can get past the sub-standard video quality, these are well worth owning, whether you grew up in the 60s (as I did) or you are curious about the entertainment of that era.\\n\\nThese shows make a person feel happy.  The reason is that if you look closely you can see that the entertainers are often enjoying themselves.  It's infectious.  It makes you want to share in their happiness.  A person can see that although it may have been a job for the entertainers, especially the dancers, and a lot of work went into the show, they liked what they were doing.  It's mostly very upbeat.  This is in contrast to much of the entertainment today, which is drenched in empty electronica, fake drums, and urban anger.  Hullaballo was about the beat (\"Feel that beat, comin on...), the excitement and the dancing.  The dancers were a very important part of this show.  Watch closely during the Hullaballo A Go Go segments and you will conclude that they are really having fun while they are working.  With all of the depressing musical entertainment that exists today, it's refreshing to listen to (mostly)upbeat music in a happy setting.  It's like leaving a cold gray rainy winter day to go to a beautiful June wedding reception.  So, if you enjoy dancing, or want some escapist happiness, buy this and have a good time!

But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations &amp; successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &amp;/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer &amp; others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act &amp; a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued &amp; given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia &amp; hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals &amp; well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed &amp; not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show &amp; radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest &amp; what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve &amp; Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year &amp; hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this &amp; it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later &amp; the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin &amp; cliched &amp; the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing &amp; singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock &amp; his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written &amp; then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums &amp; on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings &amp; a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.</td>\n","      <td>the template of Christmas albums &amp; bands</td>\n","      <td>7.0</td>\n","      <td>5259</td>\n","      <td>CD</td>\n","      <td>[in, the, s, if, anyone, had, said, that,

creation of tso none of them would have predicted that savatage would also eventually completely morph into tso but there s no christmas album like this it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later the highlight of the tso catalog let alone one of the best christmas rock albums made so it s really no surprise that tso would eclipse its root band the lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin cliched the storyline takes itself too serious but there s no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album let alone the high caliber of playing singing across the board the biggest loss though is savatage vocalist zak stevens relegated to the chorus as he s one of the most under rated powerhouses in rock his operatic vocals are perfect for this project but luckily he s found new success in circle ii circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight speaking of lyrics the biggest hurdle with the album is that the page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song if not skipped at all while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis which also suffers from stilted writing the story ca nt be fully understood via music along but this is a problem shared with all the savatage tso albums finding a climax with savatage s the wake of magellan where the songs were written then a story put over it afterwards on later albums on future tours tso would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season but on this debut it was still a small band you do nt have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later tso is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment it s quite a contrast to s double album night castle with musicians strings a large choir but that being said for christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else while everyone

He is miles away from showing himself off with what he's doing which seems to be the usual these days. And the sound of that kit? In my humble opinion that's the way a drumkit should sound, wide open,lots of projection and sweet tom-toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit, which is the current tendency. Listening to this DVD, even though I still haven't done it 5.1 is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music. The track performed are in that interesting area among jazz,rock and fusion so there is something for everyone here. The interview with Simon talking about the 5.1 mix, which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters. Least but not last, even though this DVD has no subtitles, is perfectly understandable because of Simon's slow and plain british accent, so it won't be a problem for any audiences worldwide.\\nFive stars/thumbs for Simon....again!</td>\n","      <td>Exciting, amusing and very useful.</td>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>1642</td>\n","      <td>CD</td>\n","      <td>[i, imagine, simon, phillips, needs, no, introduction, indeed, so, we, can, skip, that, part, the, amazing, thing, about, this, long, awaited, dvd, is, the, fact, that, all, these, great, and, complicated, stuff, phillips, executes, are, whithin, the, context, of, great, music, written, by, him, and, performed, with, two, other, great, musicians, otherwise, what, would, be, the, point, of, such, amazing, technique, and, skill, through, very, clear, chapters, simon, explains, how, to, tune, why, he, position, himself, like, that, behind, the, kit, etc, in, a, humble, way, only, great, a, talented, people, can, show, the, double, bass, technique, is, explained, and, ...]</td>\n","      <td>i imagine simon phillips needs no introduction indeed so we can skip that part the amazing thing about this long awaited dvd is the fact that all these great and complicated stuff phillips executes are whithin the context of great music written by him and performed with two other great musicians otherwise what would be the point of such amazing technique and skill through very clear chapters simon explains how to tune why he position himself like that behind the kit etc in a humble way only great a talented people can show the double bass technique is explained and shown in a very useful and understandable way so you can play or practice along he is miles away from showing himself off with what he s doing which seems to be the usual these days and the sound of that kit in my humble opinion that s the way a drumkit should sound wide open lots of projection and sweet tom toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit which is the current tendency listening to this dvd even though i still have nt done it is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music the track performed are in that interesting area among jazz rock and fusion so there is something for everyone here the interview with simon talking about the mix which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters least but not last even though this dvd has no subtitles is perfectly understandable because of simon s slow and plain british accent so it wo nt be a problem for any audiences worldwide five stars thumbs for simon again</td>\n","      <td>[i, imagin, simon, phillip, need, no, introduct, inde, so, we, can, skip, that, part, the, amaz, thing, about, this, long, await, dvd, is, the, fact, that, all, these, great, and, complic, stuff, phillip, execut, are, whithin, the, context, of, great, music, written, by, him, and, perform, with, two, other, great, musician, otherwis, what, would, be, the, point, of, such, amaz, techniqu, and, skill, through, veri, clear, chapter, simon, explain, how, to, tune, whi, he, posit, himself, like, that, behind, the, kit, etc, in, a, humbl, way, onli, great, a, talent, peopl, can, show, the, doubl, bass, techniqu, is, explain, and, ...]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0788602144</th>\n","      <td>I rate this and the other Hullabaloo DVD and VHS sets 4 stars rather than 5 only because most of the color tapes were trashed.

The reason is that if you look closely you can see that the entertainers are often enjoying themselves.  It's infectious.  It makes you want to share in their happiness.  A person can see that although it may have been a job for the entertainers, especially the dancers, and a lot of work went into the show, they liked what they were doing.  It's mostly very upbeat.  This is in contrast to much of the entertainment today, which is drenched in empty electronica, fake drums, and urban anger.  Hullaballo was about the beat (\"Feel that beat, comin on...), the excitement and the dancing.  The dancers were a very important part of this show.  Watch closely during the Hullaballo A Go Go segments and you will conclude that they are really having fun while they are working.  With all of the depressing musical entertainment that exists today, it's refreshing to listen to (mostly)upbeat music in a happy setting.  It's like leaving a cold gray rainy winter day to go to a beautiful June wedding reception.  So, if you enjoy dancing, or want some escapist happiness, buy this and have a good time!

\n","0001393774  Keith Green had a passionate love for Jesus.  This is evident in his life as well as in his music.  He didn't preach Jesus at concerts sponsored by beer companies.  He didn't get divorced and remarried.  He didn't live a life of luxury off of his royalties while billions starved.  He was the real deal.  He was a real Christian.\\n\\nMuch of his music consists of love songs to God, and listening to this music Keith's love for Jesus encourages me.  Hearing the tender serenades of a true lover of Jesus fans the flame of the listener's own passion.  It's contagious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ...

But, it's one of the more unique histories, transformations & successes in the rock archives, let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for.\\n\\nBriefly, with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli, who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth, Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War, which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights. The instrumental \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield, gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song \"Carol of the Bells\". This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional &/or classical music metal flourishes, let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer & others. The single became the success the band was looking for ... sort of. It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs. TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions, though it was actually the same line-up but with rotating vocalists, a slightly less venonomous stage act & a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel. \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" was reissued & given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good. At one point he flys over Bosnia & hears a lone celloist.\\n\\nChristmas Eve & Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals & well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed & not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show & radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest & what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.\\n\\nChristmas Eve & Other Stories was focused on re-releasing \"Sarajevo\" a second year & hoping it would be a chart success again, but was essentially a one-off project working alongside Savatage. As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO, none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO. But, there's no Christmas album like this & it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later & the highlight of the TSO catalog, let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made ... so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band. The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin & cliched & the storyline takes itself too serious, but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album, let alone the high caliber of playing & singing across the board.\\n\\nThe biggest loss, though, is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus, as he's one of the most under-rated powerhouses in rock & his operatic vocals are perfect for this project. But, luckily, he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight.\\n\\nSpeaking of lyrics, the biggest hurdle with the album is that the 2 page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song, if not skipped at all, while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis, which also suffers from stilted writing. The story can't be fully understood via music along, but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage/TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's \"The Wake Of Magellan\" where the songs were written & then a story put over it afterwards.\\n\\nOn later albums & on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season, but on this debut it was still a small band. You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later. TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment. It's quite a contrast to 2009's double album Night Castle with 26 musicians, strings & a large choir. But, that being said, for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else, while everyone wants to sing along.  ...

It tells the story of the resurrection from Peter's eyes. It is very true to the Bible in its lyrics. Adam Where Are You is another solid song.

Truely sensational!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ...

He is miles away from showing himself off with what he's doing which seems to be the usual these days. And the sound of that kit? In my humble opinion that's the way a drumkit should sound, wide open,lots of projection and sweet tom-toms sound since he plays off the heads instead of whacking the kit, which is the current tendency. Listening to this DVD, even though I still haven't done it 5.1 is an enjoyable experience not only for drummers but for anyboby who appreciates great music. The track performed are in that interesting area among jazz,rock and fusion so there is something for everyone here. The interview with Simon talking about the 5.1 mix, which he did entirely is very interesting even for us not so involved in recording matters. Least but not last, even though this DVD has no subtitles, is perfectly understandable because of Simon's slow and plain british accent, so it won't be a problem for any audiences worldwide.\\nFive stars/thumbs for Simon....again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ...

So, we get to see mostly kinescopes.  But, if you can get past the sub-standard video quality, these are well worth owning, whether you grew up in the 60s (as I did) or you are curious about the entertainment of that era.\\n\\nThese shows make a person feel happy.  The reason is that if you look closely you can see that the entertainers are often enjoying themselves.  It's infectious.  It makes you want to share in their happiness.  A person can see that although it may have been a job for the entertainers, especially the dancers, and a lot of work went into the show, they liked what they were doing.  It's mostly very upbeat.  This is in contrast to much of the entertainment today, which is drenched in empty electronica, fake drums, and urban anger.  Hullaballo was about the beat (\"Feel that beat, comin on...), the excitement and the dancing.  The dancers were a very important part of this show.  Watch closely during the Hullaballo A Go Go segments and you will conclude that they are really having fun while they are working.  With all of the depressing musical entertainment that exists today, it's refreshing to listen to (mostly)upbeat music in a happy setting.  It's like leaving a cold gray rainy winter day to go to a beautiful June wedding reception.  So, if you enjoy dancing, or want some escapist happiness, buy this and have a good time!

However, what this TV Special showcases is the magnitude of Benatar's sizzlingly raucous & sweet voice as she strums through megahits up to her Get Nervous multi-platinum album, including grammy-award winning Fire & Ice, as well as Hit Me With Your Best Shot & Heartbreaker.  What is most surprising about this performance, particularly for lesser fans, is that the album trax are the more astounding performances, both tune-wise and vocally.  The title track to Pat's first album In The Heat of The Night is a blindingly electric and sultry hot in the city type trak and the wondrous single Shadows of The Night sends shivers up your back from the opening guitar chords.  Personal faves are the medley I Want Out & We Live For Love, which really wakens the crowd up & a rip -roaring rendition of You Better Run, where Pat brutally warns off an offending lover.  The eloquent rock track Hell Is For Children unveils the force of Benatar's voice and ends of a marvellous tour de force performance which reveals Pat at the top of her game.  It would have been nice to see Little Paradise which was also included on the VHS version of the show or Promises In The Dark, which was included on the Live! cd, Live From Earth.  Nevertheless, with no other live video chronicles available this is all we have to relish of this legend & time allowing, you can still appreciate the savvy & the sheer professionalism which Pat had that have made her the star she is today.  A well-recommended purchase\n","summary             Hits With Her Best Shot

on the top 30 in US since the album Spirits Having Flown. This song is not just led by one lead vocal, but two, who were Robin Gibb, and Barry Gibb. With Maurice and Barry on guitar, Steve on drum, Alan on rhythem guitar, Simon on keyboards and a bass guitar, the song sounded better than any other songs.\\n  Stayin' Alive was written before Saturday Night Fever was even out, so you can see how good the Bee Gees can rock.

This song is not just led by one lead vocal, but two, who were Robin Gibb, and Barry Gibb. With Maurice and Barry on guitar, Steve on drum, Alan on rhythem guitar, Simon on keyboards and a bass guitar, the song sounded better than any other songs.\\n  Stayin' Alive was written before Saturday Night Fever was even out, so you can see how good the Bee Gees can rock. The song in this CD is live, so good to hear how Barry Gibb uses his falsetto voice in the live concert.\\n  The other two songs are also excellent. You Should Be Dancing is Bee Gees' first super-rock song to be US Chart #1. The other song never had been in any other albums, so get a copy and listen to it!\\n  My last word is - A GREAT SINGLE.  ...
